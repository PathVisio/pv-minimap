PathVisio-MiniMap
==========

Plugin for PathVisio that adds a MiniMap side panel for navigation in large pathways

This was implemented as a patch for PathVisio by Jake Fried - http://developers.pathvisio.org/ticket/1184.

In PathVisio 3 this makes a lot more sense, implemented as a plugin. Only slight changes were necessary.
